0 Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line. 1 Write a function that prints a string in reverse. 2 Write a function that returns the length of a string. 3 Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number. 4 Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y. 5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer mandatory Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n); If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1 FYI: The standard library provides a different function: sqrt. Run man sqrt to learn more. 6. Inception. Is it possible? mandatory Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

Prototype: int is_prime_number(int n); 7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything Write a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

Prototype: int is_palindrome(char *s); An empty string is a palindrome 8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible... Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.

Prototype: int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2); s2 can contain the special character *. The special char * can replace any string (including an empty string)
